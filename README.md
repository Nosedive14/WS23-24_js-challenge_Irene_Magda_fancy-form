JS team challenge to create an interactive form with validations
Create a form with a submit button. On submit (when you click the button) a pop up window is opened and prints the information that was inputted to the form, like a confirmation box. 
For example, a sign up to the site form - a user must type their username, email and their age - the pop up window shows and alerts a message:
"username:
paulien
email address:
paulien@gmail.com
age: 26
"
The rules:
use vanilla Javascript (no JS frameworks of any kind)
define the proper input for form fields - every time when a user miss to write an adequate text into the field, the field highlights in red (or other color) to show the wrong input (e.g. username which is defined to have a first capital letter by default or email address which has to have "@" and/or .com / .org)
styling is your choice, you can use (or don't use at all) any method for styling your project.
Cool to have:
make the input validation yourself and improve the standard one. (e.g. when an email misses the at sign, a message appears under the input field "an email needs to contain an @ sing", if another formatting issue exists the message would be "please enter a valid email", but if no email at all was entered and the user tries to submit the form, the message would be "email required")
some other JS functionalities by your choice (e.g. burger menu, a button that changes some colors of your page, something random and funny, ... )
